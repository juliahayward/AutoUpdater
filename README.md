# AutoUpdater
A simple application for performing auto-updates on my projects

# Principle
Normally one cannot update an application while it is running. The idea behind this updater is that, should we want an update, the application fires up a separate executable (the AutoUpdaterSlave), with the parameters necessary to pull down update files and restart the application when the process is done.

# Usage
See the test project
